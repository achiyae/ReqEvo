                        <p>The changes primarily reflect a shift in the system's login mechanism and password security requirements, indicating a change in the intended functionality and security standards. The change from username to email for login and the increased password complexity suggest a focus on enhancing security and user identification. Additionally, the inclusion of French language support indicates an expansion in the system's target user base.</p>

                        <p>The changes were made to clarify the login requirements by specifying the use of an email address instead of a username, to enhance password security by increasing the minimum length and requiring a special character, and to provide more detailed information on what profile details users can view. Additionally, the language support was expanded to include French, indicating a broader user base.</p>
