This changes the intention of the install flow from a simple 'install if requested' to a more proactive, targeted auto-install path, aligning with the new installer approach.</p>

                            <p>The primary change is the introduction of PyManager as the centralized Windows installation manager, replacing the prior plan of multiple separate installers with a single workflow. This new approach defines a concrete user-facing model where 'python' is the default launcher and 'py' manages multiple runtimes, distributed via MSIX/Store alongside python.org packaging, and accompanied by new governance/configuration mechanisms. In short, the core requirement scope shifts from describing existing installer formats to formalizing a new unified install manager and its command semantics, deployment model, and ecosystem integration.</p>

<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-TODO: Raise open issues</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+Generate packages for old versions</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+----------------------------------</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+At present, we can install versions of Python back to 3.5 from the NuGet feed.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+These are identical to the traditional installer releases of the same versions,</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+but do not include Tkinter, IDLE, documentation, or the test suite. However, it</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+is very little work (and no additional storage space) to use them for older</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+releases.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+New binaries releases will generate new packages, even for already released</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+versions (currently 3.12 and 3.13). So these will exist. The open issue is</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+whether we go back through old releases and generate full PyManager packages for</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+them all, and how far back to go. This is merely repackaging, and does not</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+require rebuilding or modifying the release.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+Include test suite in PyManager packages</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+----------------------------------------</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+The test suite consumes the majority of the size of our current distribution,</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+but is not intended to be used by most of our users. By omitting it from the</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+standard PyManager package, all downloads become smaller and faster, at the cost</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+of some users having to obtain the test suite in another way (such as building</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+from source).</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+It seems obviously preferable to have some way to access the exact test suite</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+intended for a particular build. So the question is whether to include it by</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+default (there are no optional components anymore), to publish it independently</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+(for manual download as a ZIP file), or to publish a second feed of packages</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+that include both the runtime and the test suite.</span>

This narrows the scope to newer versions and changes how older versions are distributed, reflecting a change in distribution strategy.</p>

<span class="diff-line diff-added">+The existing installer optionally allows installation of the Python standard</span>

<span class="diff-line diff-added">+are necessary for most users, but they are convenient for some. Preliminary</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+testing shows that omitting the test suite and debug symbols saves about 60% of</span>

<span class="diff-line diff-added">+to the default, ``PythonCore``). For example, where ``py install 3.13`` would</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+install the default, ``py install PythonTest\\3.13`` would install a second</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-added">+runtime with the additional files (which can either be launched with ``py</span>

<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-===========</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-Generate packages for old versions</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-At present, we can install versions of Python back to 3.5 from the NuGet feed.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-These are identical to the traditional installer releases of the same versions,</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-but do not include Tkinter, IDLE, documentation, or the test suite. However, it</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-is very little work (and no additional storage space) to use them for older</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-releases.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-New binaries releases will generate new packages, even for already released</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-versions (currently 3.12 and 3.13). So these will exist. The open issue is</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-whether we go back through old releases and generate full PyManager packages for</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-them all, and how far back to go. This is merely repackaging, and does not</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-require rebuilding or modifying the release.</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-Include test suite in PyManager packages</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-The test suite consumes the majority of the size of our current distribution,</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-but is not intended to be used by most of our users. By omitting it from the</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-standard PyManager package, all downloads become smaller and faster, at the cost</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-of some users having to obtain the test suite in another way (such as building</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-from source).</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-It seems obviously preferable to have some way to access the exact test suite</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-intended for a particular build. So the question is whether to include it by</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-default (there are no optional components anymore), to publish it independently</span>
<span class="diff-line diff-removed">-(for manual download as a ZIP file), or to publish a second feed of packages</span>
